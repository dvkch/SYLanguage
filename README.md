SYLanguage
=======

Very dirty way to have per-app language settings in your iOS app.

When I say dirty, I mean dirty. Swizzling dirty. Unresolvable-known-issues-with-assets-catalog dirty.


Current limitations
=======

`Assets` bundle and images don't seem to work (yet?)


Deprecated
==========

Since iOS 13 users can freely choose the preferred language for your app, without you having to do anything. Since I haven't maintained this plugin in a while this is the best time to deprecate it.

Read the code, share it, update it, fork it, it's all yours now. 

Please do not open an issue.
